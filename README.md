# multifactor-analysis
A quant project base on 20 factor selection, including technical, growth, evaluation and capital structure factor, to select factor and its weight to create a portfolio

Please view the mul.py. Current process is to extract stock factor from an single stock so I use aapl where financial ratios are more easily to find.
